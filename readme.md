#Introduction to Data Science Notes

##Lesson 1

To get brushed up on python https://www.udacity.com/course/programming-foundations-with-python--ud036

####Python Pandas
Handle data in a way suited for analysis
Similiar to R So nice pick up

Data frames: string, int, float, bolean. Similiar to excel spreadsheets

Create a data frame. create a python dictionary called d where each key is the name of the column. Then the name of the data frames and the index of where you want them to go.
In fare, there was a NaN and so it is 'skipped' in the data frame and indexes are given to everything else

```python
d = {'name': Series(['Braund', 'Cummings', 'Heikkinen', 'Allen'], index=['a', 'b', 'c', 'd']),
	'age': Series([22,38,26,35], index=['a','b','c','d']),
	'fare': Series([7.25,71.83,.8.05], index=['a','b','d'])
	'survived': Series([False, True, True, False], index=['a', 'b', 'c', 'd'])}
```
Now that this is created, we can actually pass this on to the data frame function to create the actual dataframe.
```python
df = DataFrame(d)
```
print (df)

returns a 'excel' like info

```python
import pandas as pd

'''
The following code is to help you play with the concept of Series in Pandas.

You can think of Series as an one-dimensional object that is similar to
an array, list, or column in a database. By default, it will assign an
index label to each item in the Series ranging from 0 to N, where N is
the number of items in the Series minus one.

Please feel free to play around with the concept of Series and see what it does

*This playground is inspired by Greg Reda's post on Intro to Pandas Data Structures:
http://www.gregreda.com/2013/10/26/intro-to-pandas-data-structures/
'''
# Change False to True to create a Series object
if False:
    series = pd.Series(['Dave', 'Cheng-Han', 'Udacity', 42, -1789710578])
    print series

'''
You can also manually assign indices to the items in the Series when
creating the series
'''

# Change False to True to see custom index in action
if False:
    series = pd.Series(['Dave', 'Cheng-Han', 359, 9001],
                       index=['Instructor', 'Curriculum Manager',
                              'Course Number', 'Power Level'])
    print series

'''
You can use index to select specific items from the Series
'''
# Change False to True to see Series indexing in action
if False:
    series = pd.Series(['Dave', 'Cheng-Han', 359, 9001],
                       index=['Instructor', 'Curriculum Manager',
                              'Course Number', 'Power Level'])
    print series['Instructor']
    print ""
    print series[['Instructor', 'Curriculum Manager', 'Course Number']]

'''
You can also use boolean operators to select specific items from the Series
'''
# Change False to True to see boolean indexing in action
if False:
    cuteness = pd.Series([1, 2, 3, 4, 5], index=['Cockroach', 'Fish', 'Mini Pig',
                                                 'Puppy', 'Kitten'])
    print cuteness > 3
    print ""
    print cuteness[cuteness > 3]

###More Examples
import numpy as np
import pandas as pd

'''
The following code is to help you play with the concept of Dataframe in Pandas.

You can think of a Dataframe as something with rows and columns. It is
similar to a spreadsheet, a database table, or R's data.frame object.

*This playground is inspired by Greg Reda's post on Intro to Pandas Data Structures:
http://www.gregreda.com/2013/10/26/intro-to-pandas-data-structures/
'''

'''
To create a dataframe, you can pass a dictionary of lists to the Dataframe
constructor:
1) The key of the dictionary will be the column name
2) The associating list will be the values within that column.
'''
# Change False to True to see Dataframes in action
if False:
    data = {'year': [2010, 2011, 2012, 2011, 2012, 2010, 2011, 2012],
            'team': ['Bears', 'Bears', 'Bears', 'Packers', 'Packers', 'Lions',
                     'Lions', 'Lions'],
            'wins': [11, 8, 10, 15, 11, 6, 10, 4],
            'losses': [5, 8, 6, 1, 5, 10, 6, 12]}
    football = pd.DataFrame(data)
    print football

'''
Pandas also has various functions that will help you understand some basic
information about your data frame. Some of these functions are:
1) dtypes: to get the datatype for each column
2) describe: useful for seeing basic statistics of the dataframe's numerical
   columns
3) head: displays the first five rows of the dataset
4) tail: displays the last five rows of the dataset
'''
# Change False to True to see these functions in action
if False:
    data = {'year': [2010, 2011, 2012, 2011, 2012, 2010, 2011, 2012],
            'team': ['Bears', 'Bears', 'Bears', 'Packers', 'Packers', 'Lions',
                     'Lions', 'Lions'],
            'wins': [11, 8, 10, 15, 11, 6, 10, 4],
            'losses': [5, 8, 6, 1, 5, 10, 6, 12]}
    football = pd.DataFrame(data)
    print football.dtypes
    print ""
    print football.describe()
    print ""
    print football.head()
    print ""
    print football.tail()
```

####Python Numpy
Multidimentional arrays + Matrices
Mathematical functions
Like Statistical analysis
numbers = [1,2,3,4,5]

Mean
numpy.mean(numbers)
return 3.0

Median
numpy.median(numbers)
return 3.0

Standard Deviation
numpy.std(numbers)
returns 1.4142...

#####Numpy Examples
import numpy as np

'''
The following code is to help you play with Numpy, which is a library
that provides functions that are especially useful when you have to
work with large arrays and matrices of numeric data, like doing
matrix matrix multiplications. Also, Numpy is battle tested and
optimized so that it runs fast, much faster than if you were working
with Python lists directly.
'''

'''
The array object class is the foundation of Numpy, and Numpy arrays are like
lists in Python, except that every thing inside an array must be of the
same type, like int or float.
'''
# Change False to True to see Numpy arrays in action
if False:
    array = np.array([1, 4, 5, 8], float)
    print array
    print ""
    array = np.array([[1, 2, 3], [4, 5, 6]], float)  # a 2D array/Matrix
    print array

'''
You can index, slice, and manipulate a Numpy array much like you would with a
a Python list.
'''
# Change False to True to see array indexing and slicing in action
if False:
    array = np.array([1, 4, 5, 8], float)
    print array
    print ""
    print array[1]
    print ""
    print array[:2]
    print ""
    array[1] = 5.0
    print array[1]

# Change False to True to see Matrix indexing and slicing in action
if False:
    two_D_array = np.array([[1, 2, 3], [4, 5, 6]], float)
    print two_D_array
    print ""
    print two_D_array[1][1]
    print ""
    print two_D_array[1, :]
    print ""
    print two_D_array[:, 2]

'''
Here are some arithmetic operations that you can do with Numpy arrays
'''
# Change False to True to see Array arithmetics in action
if False:
    array_1 = np.array([1, 2, 3], float)
    array_2 = np.array([5, 2, 6], float)
    print array_1 + array_2
    print ""
    print array_1 - array_2
    print ""
    print array_1 * array_2

# Change False to True to see Matrix arithmetics in action
if False:
    array_1 = np.array([[1, 2], [3, 4]], float)
    array_2 = np.array([[5, 6], [7, 8]], float)
    print array_1 + array_2
    print ""
    print array_1 - array_2
    print ""
    print array_1 * array_2

'''
In addition to the standard arthimetic operations, Numpy also has a range of
other mathematical operations that you can apply to Numpy arrays, such as
mean and dot product.

Both of these functions will be useful in later programming quizzes.
'''
if False:
    array_1 = np.array([1, 2, 3], float)
    array_2 = np.array([[6], [7], [8]], float)
    print np.mean(array_1)
    print np.mean(array_2)
    print ""
    print np.dot(array_1, array_2)

    olympic_medal_counts_df = DataFrame(d)
    return olympic_medal_counts_df

    ##How to access the Data

    df = DataFrame(d)

    df['name']

    returns name column.

    df.loc['a']

    Only want rows where age is greater than 30

    df[df['age'] >= 30]
    only survivor info

    df['survived?'][df['age'] >= 30]
RETURNED
    b true
    d false

import pandas as pd

'''
You can think of a DataFrame as a group of Series that share an index.
This makes it easy to select specific columns that you want from the
DataFrame.

Also a couple pointers:
1) Selecting a single column from the DataFrame will return a Series
2) Selecting multiple columns from the DataFrame will return a DataFrame

Row selection can be done through multiple ways.

Some of the basic and common methods are:
   1) Slicing
   2) An individual index (through the functions iloc or loc)

operators like & (and) or | (or)

df.apply(numpy.mean) aplies this to every data point

As a refresher on lambda, lambda functions are small inline functions that are defined on-the-fly in Python. lambda x: x>= 1 will take an input x and return x>=1, or a boolean that equals True or False.

In this example, map() and applymap() create a new Series or DataFrame by applying the lambda function to each element. Note that map() can only be used on a Series to return a new Series and applymap() can only be used on a DataFrame to return a new DataFrame.

For further reference, please refer to the official documentation on lambda:

#### Average Bronze Medals

from pandas import DataFrame, Series

```python

from pandas import DataFrame, Series
import numpy


def avg_medal_count():
    '''
    Compute the average number of bronze medals earned by countries who
    earned at least one gold medal.

    Save this to a variable named avg_bronze_at_least_one_gold.

    HINT-1:
    You can retrieve all of the values of a Pandas column from a
    data frame, "df", as follows:
    df['column_name']

    HINT-2:
    The numpy.mean function can accept as an argument a single
    Pandas column.

    For example, numpy.mean(df["col_name"]) would return the
    mean of the values located in "col_name" of a dataframe df.

##Titanic Survivors

```python

import numpy
import pandas
import statsmodels.api as sm

def simple_heuristic(file_path):
    '''
    In this exercise, we will perform some rudimentary practices similar to those of
    an actual data scientist.

    Part of a data scientist's job is to use her or his intuition and insight to
    write algorithms and heuristics. A data scientist also creates mathematical models
    to make predictions based on some attributes from the data that they are examining.

    We would like for you to take your knowledge and intuition about the Titanic
    and its passengers' attributes to predict whether or not the passengers survived
    or perished. You can read more about the Titanic and specifics about this dataset at:
    http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/RMS_Titanic
    http://www.kaggle.com/c/titanic-gettingStarted

    In this exercise and the following ones, you are given a list of Titantic passengers
    and their associated information. More information about the data can be seen at the
    link below:
    http://www.kaggle.com/c/titanic-gettingStarted/data.

    For this exercise, you need to write a simple heuristic that will use
    the passengers' gender to predict if that person survived the Titanic disaster.

    You prediction should be 78% accurate or higher.

    Here's a simple heuristic to start off:
       1) If the passenger is female, your heuristic should assume that the
       passenger survived.
       2) If the passenger is male, you heuristic should
       assume that the passenger did not survive.

    You can access the gender of a passenger via passenger['Sex'].
    If the passenger is male, passenger['Sex'] will return a string "male".
    If the passenger is female, passenger['Sex'] will return a string "female".

    Write your prediction back into the "predictions" dictionary. The
    key of the dictionary should be the passenger's id (which can be accessed
    via passenger["PassengerId"]) and the associated value should be 1 if the
    passenger survied or 0 otherwise.

    For example, if a passenger is predicted to have survived:
    passenger_id = passenger['PassengerId']
    predictions[passenger_id] = 1

    And if a passenger is predicted to have perished in the disaster:
    passenger_id = passenger['PassengerId']
    predictions[passenger_id] = 0

    You can also look at the Titantic data that you will be working with
    at the link below:
    https://www.dropbox.com/s/r5f9aos8p9ri9sa/titanic_data.csv
    '''

    predictions = {}
    df = pandas.read_csv(file_path)
    for passenger_index, passenger in df.iterrows():
        passenger_id = passenger['PassengerId']

        # Your code here:
        # For example, let's assume that if the passenger
